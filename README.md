# winforms-diet-app
This is a calorie tracker app developed as winforms by a team of 4 people. 

In this app, you have to create an account to access its features. Once you login, you can set your goals according to your needs.
The app recommends a daily total calorie, which you may want to change freely. You may want to lose, gain or keep your current weight. 

Once you add foods to your meal, it shows how many calories you got for that day and allows you to track macronutrients as well. You can add your own custom food to your food list if you wish.
Besides, the app comes with all the calculations you may need on the journey of healthy life.

This project has been developed for learning purposes. You can check my teammates' profiles ðŸ‘‡
